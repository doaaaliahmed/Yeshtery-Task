The task is to implement this design in react following these rules:
● File types should be js + jsx + scss. 

● Folder structure:
○ public/images for static images.
○ src/images for dynamic images (dummy data images).
○ src/services for api calls (dummy data for the test).
○ src/components for other react components.
○ src/pages for router pages.
● Data should be passed via props or returned by an api.
● Should depend on two colors in css variables ( --primary-color , --secondary-color ).
● Should use lazy loading at least at one component.
● Shouldn't use hooks.
● Shouldn't use redux.
● The only required functionality is “add to cart”.
● add to cart functionality can be divided in 2 cases:
○ Empty cart:
■ Cart icon should have a badge containing 0 when cart is empty
■ Clicking on the top cart icon should show the empty cart dropdown
○ Non empty cart:
■ Cart icon should have a badge containing the number of cart items
■ Clicking on the top cart icon should show cart items dropdown
○ In both cases Pressing the "Add to cart" button should increment the items at
cart by quantity.
● Task should be delivered as a github public repository and deployed to github pages.
